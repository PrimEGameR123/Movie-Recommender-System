(Tags contains all the information of a particular movie, e.g., Keywords, Description, Cast and Crew.) <br>
3. Filtering the Movie_tags by removing stop words & perforimg word stemming. <br>
4. Vectorising the Movie_tags by a method called Bag_of_words and then making a dataframe for every movie with their vectors. <br>
5. Calculating score of every movie in the data against every movie. <br>
6. The movies nearest to the score of selected movie will be shown as recommended movies.
